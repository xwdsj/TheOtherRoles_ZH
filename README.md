# Settings
The mod adds a few new settings to Among Us (in addition to the role settings):
- **Streamer Mode:** You can activate the streamer mode in the Among Us settings. It hides the lobby code, the custom server ip and the custom server port. You can set a custom lobby code replacement text, by changing the *Streamer Mode Replacement Text* in the `BepInEx\config\me.eisbison.theotherroles.cfg` file.
- **Number of Impostors:** The number of Impostor count be set inside a lobby
- **Map:** The map can be changed inside a lobby
- **Maximum Number Of Meetings:** You can set the maximum number of meetings that can be called in total (Every player still has personal maximum of buttons, but if the maximum number of meetings is reached you can't use your meetings even if you have some left. Impostor and Jackal meetings also count)
- **Allow Skips On Emergency Meetings:** If set to false, there will not be a skip button in emergency meetings. If a player does not vote, they'll vote themself.
- **Hide Player Names:** Hides the names of all players that have role which is unknown to you. Team Lovers/Impostors/Jackal still see the names of their teammates. Impostors can also see the name of the Spy and everyone can still see the age of the mini.
- **Allow Parallel MedBay Scans:** Allows players to perform their MedBay scans at the same time
- **Ghosts Can See Roles**
- **Ghosts Can See Votes**
- **Ghosts Can See The Number Of Remaining Tasks**

- **Darker/Lighter:** Displays color type of each player in meetings

### Task Count Limits per map
You can configure:
- Up to 4 common tasks
- Up to 23 short tasks
- Up to 15 long tasks

Please note, that if the configured option exceeds the available number of tasks of a map, the tasks will be limited to that number of tasks. \
Example: If you configure 4 common tasks on Airship crewmates will only receive 2 common tasks, as airship doesn't offer more than 2 common tasks.

| Map | Common Tasks | Short Tasks | Long Tasks |
|----------|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| Skeld / Dleks | 2 | 19 | 8
| Mira HQ | 2 | 13 | 11

# Custom Hats
## Create and submit new hat designs
We're awaiting your creative hat designs and we'll integrate all the good ones in our mod.
Here are a few instructions, on how to create a custom hat:

- **Creation:** A hat consists of up to three textures. The aspect ratio of the textures has to be `4:5`, we recommend `300px:375px`:
  - `Main texture (required)`:
    - This is the main texture of your hat. It will usually be rendered in front of the player, if you set the `behind` parameter it will be rendered behind the player.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern *hatname.png*, but you can also set some additional parameters in the file name by adding `_parametername` to the file name (before the *.png*).
    - Parameter `bounce`: This parameter determines whether the hat will bounce while you're walking or not.
    - Parameter `adaptive`: If this parameter is set, the Among Us coloring shader will be applied (the shader that replaces some colors with the colors that your character is wearing in the game). The color red (#ff0000) will be replaced with the primary color of your player and the color blue (#0000ff) with the secondary color. Also other colors will be affected and changed, you can have a look at the texture of the [Crewmate Hat](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/among-us-wiki/images/e/e0/Crewmate_hat.png) to see how this feature should be used.
    - Parameter `behind`: If this parameter is set, the main texture will be rendered behind the player.
  - `Flipped texture (optional)`:
    - This texture will be rendered instead of the Main texture, when facing the left.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern `hatname_flip.png`.
  - `Back texture (optional)`:
    - This texture will be rendered behind the player.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern `hatname_back.png`.
  - `Flipped Back texture (optional)`:
    - This texture will be rendered instead of the Back texture, when facing the left.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern `hatname_back_flip.png`.
  - `Climb texture (optional)`:
    - This texture will be rendered in front of the player, when they're climbing.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern `hatname_climb.png`.
- **Testing:** You can test your hat design by putting all the files in the `\TheOtherHats\Test` subfolder of your mod folder. Then whenever you start a Freeplay game, you and all the dummies will be wearing the new hat. You don't need to restart Among Us if you change the hat files, just exit and reenter the Freeplay mode.

- **Submission:** If you got a hat design, you can submit it on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/77RkMJHWsM). We'll look at all the hats and add all the good ones to the game.

# Roles

## Role Assignment
We are still improving the role assignment system. It's not that intuitive right now, but it's more flexible than the older one
if you're using it right.

First you need to choose how many special roles of each kind (Impostor/Neutral/Crewmate) you want in the game.
The count you set will only be reached, if there are enough Crewmates/Impostors in the game and if enough roles are set to be in the game (i.e. they are set to > 0%). The roles are then being distributed as follows:
- First all roles that are set to 100% are being assigned to arbitrary players.
- After that each role that has 10%-90% selected adds 1-9 tickets to a ticket pool (there exists a ticket pool for Crewmates, Neutrals and Impostors). Then the roles will be selected randomly from the pools as long it's possible (until the selected number is reached, until there are no more Crewmates/Impostors or until there are no more tickets). If a role is selected from the pool, obviously all the tickets of that role are being removed.
- The Mafia, Lovers and Mini are being selected independently (without using the ticket system) according to the spawn chance you selected. After that the Crewmate, Neutral and Impostor roles are selected and assigned in a random order.

**Example:**\
Settings: 2 special Crewmate roles, Snitch: 100%, Hacker: 10%, Tracker: 30%\
Result: Snitch is assigned, then one role out of the pool [Hacker, Tracker, Tracker, Tracker] is being selected\
Note: Changing the settings to Hacker: 20%, Tracker: 60% would statistically result in the same outcome .


## Mafia
### **Team: Impostors**
The Mafia are a group of three Impostors.\
The Godfather works like a normal Impostor.\
The Mafioso is an Impostor who cannot kill until the Godfather is dead.\
The Janitor is an Impostor who cannot kill, but they can hide dead bodies instead.\
\
**NOTE:**
- There have to be 3 Impostors activated for the mafia to spawn.

### Game Options
| Name | Description |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Mafia Spawn Chance | -
| Janitor Cooldown | -
-----------------------

## Morphling
### **Team: Impostors**
The Morphling is an Impostor which can additionally scan the appearance of a player. After an arbitrary time they can take on that appearance for 10s.
\
**NOTE:**
- They shrink to the size of the Mini when they copy its look.
- The Hacker sees the new color on the admin table.
- The color of the footprints changes accordingly (also the ones that were already on the ground).
- The other Impostor still sees that they are an Impostor (the name remains red).
- The shield indicator changes accordingly (the Morphling gains or loses the shield indicator).
- Tracker and Snitch arrows keep working.

### Game Options
| Name | Description |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Morphling Spawn Chance | -
| Morphling Cooldown | -
| Morph Duration | Time the Morphling stays morphed
-----------------------

## Camouflager
### **Team: Impostors**
The Camouflager is an Impostor which can additionally activate a camouflage mode.
The camouflage mode lasts for 10s and while it is active, all player names/pets/hats
are hidden and all players have the same color.\
\
**NOTE:**
- The Mini will look like all the other players
- The color of the footprints turns gray (also the ones that were already on the ground).
- The Hacker sees gray icons on the admin table
- The shield is not visible anymore
- Tracker and Snitch arrows keep working

### Game Options
| Name | Description |
|----------|:-------------:|

| Camo Duration | Time players stay camouflaged
-----------------------

## Vampire
### **Team: Impostors**
The Vampire is an Impostor, that can bite other player. Bitten players die after a configurable amount of time.\
If the Vampire spawn chance is greater 0 (even if there is no Vampire in the game), all players can place one garlic.\
If a victim is near a garlic, the "Bite Button" turns into the default "Kill Button" and the Vampire can only perform a normal kill.\
\
**NOTE:**
- If a bitten player is still alive when a meeting is being called, they die at the start of the meeting.
- The cooldown is the same as the default kill cooldown (+ the kill delay if the Vampire bites the target).
- If there is a Vampire in the game, there can't be a Warlock.

### Game Options
| Name | Description |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Vampire Spawn Chance | -
| Vampire Kill Delay | -
| Vampire Cooldown | Sets the kill/bite cooldown
| Vampire Can Kill Near Garlics | The Vampire can never bite when their victim is near a garlic. If this option is set to true, they can still perform a normal kill there.
-----------------------

## Eraser
### **Team: Impostors**
The Eraser is an Impostor that can erase the role of every player.\
The targeted players will lose their role after the meeting right before a player is exiled.\
After every erase, the cooldown increases by 10 seconds.\
The erase will be performed, even if the Eraser or their target die before the next meeting.\
By default the Eraser can erase everyone but the Spy and other Impostors. Depending on the options
they can also erase them (Impostors will lose their special Impostor ability).
\
**NOTE:**
- The Shifter shift will always be triggered before the Erase (hence either the new role of the Shifter will be erased or the Shifter saves the role of their target, depending on whom the Eraser erased)
- Erasing a Lover automatically erases the other Lover as well (if the second Lover is an ImpLover, they will turn into an Impostor)
- Erasing a Jackal that has a Sidekick, triggers the Sidekick promotion if it's activated in the settings
- As the erase is being triggered before the ejection of a player, erasing and voting out a Lover in the same round, would result in the
ex-Lover surviving, as the partnership was erased before. Also a Jester win would not happen, as the erase will be triggered before.

### Game Options
| Name | Description |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Eraser Spawn Chance | -
| Eraser Cooldown | The Eraser's cooldown will increase by 10 seconds after every erase.
| Eraser Can Erase Anyone | If set to false, they can't erase the Spy and other Impostors

## Trickster
### **Team: Impostors**
The Trickster is an Impostor that can place 3 jack-in-the-boxes that are invisible at first to other players. \
If the Trickster has placed all of their boxes they will be converted into a vent network usable only by the Trickster themself, but the boxes are revealed to the others. \
If the boxes are converted to a vent network, the Trickster gains a new ability "Lights out" to limit the visibility of Non-Impostors, that cannot be fixed by other players. Lights are automatically restored after a while.\

\
**NOTE:**
- Impostors will get a text indicator at the bottom of the screen to notify them if the lights are out due to the Trickster ability, as there is no sabotage arrows or task to sabotage text to otherwise notify them about it.

### Game Options
| Name | Description |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Trickster Spawn Chance | -
| Trickster Box Cooldown | Cooldown for placing jack-in-the-boxes

### **Team: Impostors**

Performing a kill with the help of a cursed player, will lift the curse and it will result in the Warlock being unable to move for a configurable amount of time.\
The Warlock can still perform normal kills, but the two buttons share the same cooldown.\

\
**NOTE:**
- The Warlock can always kill their Impostor mates (and even themself) using the "cursed kill"

The target of the Bounty Hunter swaps after every meeting and after a configurable amount of time.\
If the Bounty Hunter kills their target, their kill cooldown will be a lot less than usual.\
Killing a player that's not their current target results in an increased kill cooldown.\
Depending on the options, there'll be an arrow pointing towards the current target.\
\
**NOTE:**
- The target won't be an Impostor, a Spy or the Bounty Hunter's Lover.

There are multiple options listed down below with which you can configure to fit your taste.\
Similar to the Vampire, shields and blanks will be checked twice (at the end of casting the spell on the player and at the end of the meeting, when the spell will be activated).\
This can result in players being marked as spelled during the meeting, but not dying in the end (when they get a shield or the Witch gets blanked after they were spelled by the Witch).\
If the Witch dies before the meeting starts or if the Witch is being guessed during the meeting, the spellbound players will be highlighted but they'll survive in any case.\
Depending on the options you can choose whether voting the Witch out will save all the spellbound players or not.\

\
**NOTE:**
- The spellbound players will die before the voted player dies (which might trigger e.g. trigger an Impostor win condition, even if the Witch is the one being voted)

-----------------------


## Guesser
### **Team: Crewmates or Impostors**
The Guesser can be a Crewmate or an Impostor (depending on the settings).\
The Guesser can shoot players during the meeting, by guessing its role. If the guess is wrong, the Guesser dies instead.\
You can select how many players can be shot per game and if multiple players can be shot during a single meeting.\
The guesses Impostor and Crewmate are only right, if the player is part of the corresponding team and has no special role.\
You can only shoot during the voting time.\
Depending on the options, the Guesser can't guess the shielded player and depending on the Medic options the Medic/shielded player might be notified (no one will die, independently of what the Guesser guessed).\
\
**NOTE:**
- If a player gets shot, you'll get back your votes
- You can't guess the role **Nice Mini** for obvious reasons

## Lovers
### **Team: Lovers (and secondary team)**
There are always two Lovers which are linked together.\
Their primary goal is it to stay alive together until the end of the game.\
If one Lover dies (and the option is activated), the other Lover suicides.\
You can select if Lovers are able to have a second role (could be a Neutral, Crewmate or Impostor Role)\
You can specify the chance of one Lover being an Impostor.\
The Lovers never know the role of their partner, they only see who their partner is.\
The Lovers win, if they are both alive when the game ends. They can also win with their original team (e.g. a dead Impostor Lover can win with the Impostors, an Arsonist Lover can still achieve an Arsonist win)\
If one of the Lovers is a killer (i.e. Jackal/Sidekick/Impostor), they can achieve a "Lovers solo win" where only the Lovers win.\
If there is no killer among the Lovers (e.g. an Arsonist Lover + Crewmate Lover) and they are both alive when the game ends, they win together with the Crewmates.\
If there's a team Impostor/Jackal Lover in the game, the tasks of a Crewmate Lover won't be counted (for a task win) as long as they're alive. If the Lover dies, their tasks will also be counted.\
You can enable an exclusive chat only for Lovers\
\
**NOTE:**
- In a 2 Cremates vs 2 Impostors (or 2 members of team Jackal) and the Lovers are not in the same team, the game is not automatically over since the Lovers can still achieve a solo win. E.g. if there are the following roles Impostor + ImpLover + Lover + Crewmate left, the game will not end and the next kill will decide if the Impostors or Lovers win.
- The Lovers can change if the Shifter takes the role of a Lovers

### Game Options

## Medic
### **Team: Crewmates**
The Medic can shield (highlighted by an outline around the player) one player per game, which makes the player unkillable.\
The shielded player can still be voted out and might also be an Impostor.\
If set in the options, the shielded player and/or the Medic will get a red flash on their screen if someone (Impostor, Sheriff, ...) tried to murder them.
If the Medic dies, the shield disappears with them.\
The Sheriff will not die if they try to kill a shielded Crewmate and won't perform a kill if they try to kill a shielded Impostor.\
Depending on the options, guesses from the Guesser will be blocked by the shield and the shielded player/medic might be notified.\
The Medic's other feature shows when they report a corpse: they will see how long ago the player died.
\
**NOTE:**
- If the shielded player is a Lover and the other Lover dies, they nevertheless kill themselves.
- If the Shifter has a shield or their target has a Shield, the shielded player switches.

## Hacker
### **Team: Crewmates**
If the Hacker activates the "Hacker mode", the Hacker gets more information than others from the admin table and vitals for a set duration.\
Otherwise they see the same information as everyone else.
**Admin table:** The Hacker can see the colors (or color types) of the players on the table.\
**Vitals**: The Hacker can see how long dead players have been dead for.\
The Hacker can access his mobile gadgets (vitals & admin table), with a maximum of charges (uses) and a configurable amount of tasks needed to recharge.\
While accessing those mobile gadgets, the Hacker is not able to move.\
\
**NOTE:**
- If the Morphling morphs or the Camouflager camouflages, the colors on the admin table change accordingly

## Shifter
### **Team: Crewmates**
The Shifter can take over the role of another Crewmate, the other player will transform into a Crewmate.\
The Shift will always be performed at the end of the next meeting right before a player is exiled. The target needs to be chosen during the round.\
Even if the Shifter or the target dies before the meeting, the Shift will still be performed.\
Swapping roles with an Impostor or Neutral fails and the Shifter commits suicide after the next meeting (there won't be any body).\
The Shifter aims to save roles from leaving the game, by e.g. taking over a Sheriff or Medic that is known to the Impostors.\
This works especially well against the Eraser, but also gives the Eraser the possibility to act like a Shifter.\
The **special interactions** with the Shifter are noted in the chapters of the respective roles.\
\
**NOTE:**
- The Shifter shift will always be triggered before the Erase (hence either the new role of the Shifter will be erased or the Shifter saves the role of their target, depending on whom the Eraser erased)
- If the Shifter takes over a role, their new cooldowns will start at the maximum cooldown of the ability
- One time use abilities (e.g. shielding a player or Engineer sabotage fix) can only used by one player in the game (i.e. the Shifter
can only use them, if the previous player did not use them before)

## Time Master
### **Team: Crewmates**
The Time Master has a time shield which they can activate. The time shield remains active for a configurable amount of time.\
If a player tries to kill the Time Master while the time shield is active, the kill won't happen and the
time will rewind for a set amount of time.\
The kill cooldown of the killer won't be reset, so the Time Master
has to make sure that the game won't result in the same situation.\
The Time Master won't be affected by the rewind.\
\
**NOTE:**
- Only the movement is affected by the rewind.
- A Vampire bite will trigger the rewind. If the Time Master misses shielding the bite, they can still shield the kill which happens a few seconds later.
- If the Time Master was bitten and has their shield active before when a meeting is called, they survive but the time won't be rewound.
- If the Time Master has a Medic shield, they won't rewind.
- The shield itself ends immediately when triggered. So the Time Master can be attacked again as soon as the rewind ends.

## Jackal
### **Team: Jackal**
The Jackal is part of an extra team, that tries to eliminate all the other players.\
The Jackal has no tasks and can kill Impostors, Crewmates and Neutrals.\
The Jackal (if allowed by the options) can select another player to be their Sidekick.
Creating a Sidekick removes all tasks of the Sidekick and adds them to the team Jackal. The Sidekick loses their current role (except if they're a Lover, then they play in two teams).
The "Create Sidekick Action" may only be used once per Jackal or once per game (depending on the options).
The Jackal can also promote Impostors to be their Sidekick but, depending on the options the Impostor will either really turn into the Sidekick and leave the team Impostors or they will just look like the Sidekick to the Jackal and remain as they were.\
\
The team Jackal enables multiple new outcomes of the game, listing some examples here:
- The Impostors could be eliminated and then the crew plays against the team Jackal.
- The Crew could be eliminated, then the Team Jackal fight against the Impostors (The Crew can still make a task win in this scenario)

The priority of the win conditions is the following:
1. Crewmate Mini lose by vote
2. Jester wins by vote
3. Arsonist win
4. Team Impostor wins by sabotage
5. Team Crew wins by tasks (also possible if the whole Crew is dead)
6. Lovers among the last three players win
7. Team Jackal wins by outnumbering (When the team Jackal contains an equal or greater amount of players than the Crew and there are 0 Impostors left and team Jackal contains no Lover)
8. Team Impostor wins by outnumbering (When the team Impostors contains an equal or greater amount of players than the Crew and there are 0 players of the team Jackal left and team Impostors contains no Lover)
9. Team Crew wins by outnumbering (When there is no player of the team Jackal and the team Impostors left)

**NOTE:**
- The Jackal (and their Sidekick) may be killed by a Sheriff.
- A Jackal cannot target the Mini, while it's growing up. After that they can kill it or select it as its Sidekick.
- The Crew can still win, even if all of their members are dead, if they finish their tasks fast enough (That's why converting the last Crewmate with tasks left into a Sidekick results in a task win for the crew.)

If both Impostors and Jackals are in the game the game, continues even if all Crewmates are dead. Crewmates may still win in this case by completing their tasks. Jackal and Impostor have to kill each other.

## Lawyer
### **Team: Neutral**
The Lawyer is a neutral role that has a client.
The client might be an Impostor or Jackal which is no Lover.
The Lawyer needs their client to win in order to win the game.
If their client dies or gets voted out, the Lawyer changes their role and becomes the [Pursuer](#pursuer), which has a different goal to win the game.
The main goal of the Lawyer is to win as Lawyer, as it is not allowed to betray their client.

The Lawyer can win in multiple ways:
- Lawyer dead, client alive and client team won: The Lawyer wins together with the team of the client
- Lawyer and client alive and client team won: The Lawyer wins with the team of the client. The client **doesn't** win (even if their Impostor/Team Jackal mate wins), the Lawyer steals their win. Hence the client should keep the Lawyer alive for some time, to get some help during the meetings, but has to eliminate them soon enough to not get their win stolen.

**NOTE:**
- If the client disconnects, the Lawyer will also turn into the Pursuer
- If "Lawyer Target Knows" is set to true, the client will know that someone is their Lawyer, but won't know who.

| Name | Description |

| Lawyer Vision | Pursuer has normal vision

-----------------------

## Pursuer
### **Team: Neutral**
The Pursuer is still a neutral role, but has a different goal to win the game; they have to be alive when the game ends (no matter who causes the win).
In order to achieve this goal, the Pursuer has an ability called "Blank", where they can fill a killers (this also includes the Sheriff) weapon with a blank. So, if the killer attempts to kill someone, the killer will miss their target, and their cooldowns will be triggered as usual.
If the killer fires the "Blank", shields (e.g. Medic shield or Time Master shield) will not be triggered.
The Pursuer has tasks (which can already be done while being a Lawyer), that count towards the task win for the Crewmates. If the Pursuer dies, their tasks won't be counted anymore.
